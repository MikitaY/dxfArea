# dxfArea

This is a small WPF application that allows you to calculate the area of closed shapes (polylines, lines, arcs) in dxf files.

It is implied that the file contains only a closed contour, the area of which you want to know. The correctness of the calculation of the area of complex shapes was checked by calculating the area with other graphic programs. The code contains simple mathematical functions that calculate the area based on the given coordinates of the shapes.
